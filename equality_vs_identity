Equality:
    When two things look the same 

Identity:
    Stronger than equality, when you have two things but they are actually the same thing (Where if you look at their addresses, they have the same address / if you change one, then the other one will change simultaneously)

Move Semantics (Wont be tested on, but it is good to know about regardless):

bag f()
{
    bag b(10)
    .
    .
    .
    .
    return b;

}
