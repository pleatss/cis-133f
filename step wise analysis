Step wise analysis

Pick some important operations (steps) and count how many times they occur for input size = n (unknown)

Ex: Finding max element of a vector

int max(vector<int> v)
{
    int m = v[0]; // Guess for the largest
    for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++;)
    if(v[i] > m )
        m=v[i]; //Updates guess
    
return m;

}


Asymptotic Analysis (Big O)
We say: 
            f(n) = O(g(n))

If there is k > 0, n > 0, such that for all n > n0

                f(n) < k*g(n)
            - K captures (hides) "proportionality"
            - n0 captures "big enough n"
